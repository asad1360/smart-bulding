Every structure and building can be a source of energy production
The use of fossil fuels has caused global warming and threatened humans and future generations.
We all know and are aware of these dangers
But what is important and the question to be asked is, what is the solution?
If we believe in the law of conservation of energy, we must know that energy is not wasted.
And energy is always changing from one form to another
And to be able to have this energy continuously.
 It is enough to control and direct it
Heat to cold converter, cold to heat converter, motion to electricity and ...
Finally directing all the energy used in a structure to a common source
 And energy reuse
 This model is called the energy conservation cycle in the structure
